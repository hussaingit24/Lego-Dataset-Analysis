# Lego-Dataset_Analysis

**Description:**

This Python project analyzes a dataset of LEGO sets to explore the popularity and prevalence of Star Wars-themed sets throughout the company's history. By examining the number of sets released each year and comparing them across different themes, this project aims to provide insights into the significance of Star Wars in LEGO's product lineup.

**Objectives:**

1. **Prevalence of Star Wars Sets:**
   * Calculate the percentage of all licensed sets ever released that were Star Wars themed.
2. **Dominance of Star Wars Theme:**
   * Identify the year(s) when Star Wars was not the most popular licensed theme in terms of the number of sets released.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   * Handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   * Filter the dataset to include only licensed sets.
2. **Identify Star Wars Sets:**
   * Extract Star Wars sets based on their theme names or keywords.
3. **Calculate Prevalence:**
   * Determine the total number of licensed sets and the number of Star Wars sets.
   * Calculate the percentage of Star Wars sets relative to all licensed sets.
4. **Analyze Dominance:**
   * Group the dataset by year and count the number of sets released for each theme.
   * Identify years where the count of Star Wars sets is not the highest among all licensed themes.

**Tools and Libraries:**

* **Python:**
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib (for visualizations)

**Repository Contents:**
* The Jupyter Notebook
